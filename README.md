# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements linear regression from scratch using Python — no machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. It uses gradient descent to learn the parameters.

## 📁 Files

- `linear_regression.py` – main script implementing the model
- `data.csv` – sample dataset (study time vs score)

## 📈 Features

- Manual loss function
- Manual gradient descent
- Scatter plot with fitted regression line

## 📊 Sample Output

The script fits a red line to predict exam scores based on study time.

## 🚀 Run the Project

```bash
python linear_regression.py
